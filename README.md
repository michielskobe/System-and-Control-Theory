# System-and-Control-Theory

This project tackles a problem about system stability and control theory in the context of the Systems and Control Theory course of the Bachelor in Engineering Technology at KU Leuven, academic year 2022-2023. Using MATLAB, 2 systems are investigated: an unknown system that is stable and an unstable system whose transfer function is known. The theory covered in the lectures is to be applied to these systems.
